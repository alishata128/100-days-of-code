### Day 1: June 21, 2023

**Todays's Progress:**As I'm into Scrimba's Scholarship" the Frontend Dev Career Path" I've done several projects with it but today I've finished a Project "Oldagram", which is like an instagram but for artworks and I added a color-detect-on-hover to it which done by using canvas. I've learned a lot about canvas and how it could be really usefull, 

**Thought:** Challenging Myself to be consistent and not missing even one day
